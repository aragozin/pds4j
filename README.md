Pragmatic Data Structure for Java - pds4j
=========

There are number of collection libraries availabe for Java.
Though sometimes implementing high level collection API kills
potential of underlying data structures.

This project offers implementation of few classic data strcutures
not as collections, but as low level data strcutres which can be 
used as building blocks for sophisticated collections with
unique feature tailored for specific purpose.
